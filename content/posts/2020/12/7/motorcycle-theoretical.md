Today is the day I start learning for my motorcycle exam again, one month to go. I highly recommend anyone 
learning for their theoretical exam in The Netherlands to get the ANWB online exam excerise pack for 10 euros,
it contains real exams with updated questions and I noticed that after reading the theoretical book once I was
done with it and nothing really stuck.

Using the online exam really helps as far I can tell, so far I'm getting more and more passes. But the real
test is in a month so we'll see if this actually helps.
