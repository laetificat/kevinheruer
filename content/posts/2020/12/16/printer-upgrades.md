After owning my Creality Ender 3 Pro for almost a year I got sick of the noise it made, 
over the months I did some upgrades to my printer by printing new parts and replacing 
existing parts on my printer like fan ducts, display cover, tool drawer, etc. 
But this time it was a bigger upgrade, I replaced both the hotend cooling fan (not the directional fan that cools the print) 
and the control board fan. I also replaced/upgraded the control board to a Bigtreetech SKR Mini E3 v2.0, 
the stepper motors now have become magically silent.

The only thing producing noticable noise right now is the cooling fan for the power supply, but 
that's an upgrade for another time. At least now I can print over night without the printer keeping 
me awake.
