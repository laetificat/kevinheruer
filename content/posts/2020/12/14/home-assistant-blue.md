As a big fan of Home Assistant I just have to advertise this product,
for the less technical people there is Home Assistant Blue. It's an all-in-one 
device that has all the hardware you need for controlling your home, all you 
need to do is add your smart devices. No more flashing SD cards or configuring 
your Raspberry Pi's!

Even if you're not interested in the product itself, they also released a 3D file 
of the case for you to print for your Pi! However at the moment of writing this, 
thingiverse is having some issues.
