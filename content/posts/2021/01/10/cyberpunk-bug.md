We all know Cyberpunk 2077 got a bad name these days, after years of 
hyping the game up and promising too much they really messed up. 
Nevertheless I've been enjoying the game a lot, even with the bugs.

But there is this one particular "bug" that I found after exploring the map, 
I did not do anything remotely out of the ordinary and basically broke the 
game by opening a window.

If you go to the "College St" waypoint head straight to the other side of the 
street the waypoint is facing, walking into that street you'll notice an alley 
that has a stack of newspapers in front of it, making it look like you're 
supposed to find something there. Once in the alley you can open a window and 
basically exit the map.
