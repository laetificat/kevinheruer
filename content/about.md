# Hi there

My name is Kevin and I like to learn new stuff, most of the time I break it in the process.
However I do tend to create some pretty cool things too! I'll post all things that interest
me on my blog, they may be short or long, it all depends on the fact that I'm feeling like it or not.

It's mosly computer and programming related stuff but sometimes I'll post some personal things too.
